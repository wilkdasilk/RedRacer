movement by alternating keys
track score between multiple games
resetting the board (after winning) by clicking "play again" or pressing ENTER.

### Planned Features
Additional planned features include:
slow down your rival by tripping them - press W or I
defend from being tripped and turn it back on your rival - press U or E
a stopwatch for tracking your best time across multiple games
upgrading your racer to different shapes - perhaps triangle?
